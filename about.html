    <p id="para">I was introduced to programming at university, when I was making audio effects processors or algorithmic music generators.  Back then I was using an obscure high level graphical language called <a href="http://puredata.info/" target="_blank">Pure Data</a>.  Two things immediately caught my interest about programming.  The first is the creative scope of possibilities - something which will always greatly excite me.  The second is the challenge of it, that rewarding feeling you get work out a more elegant solution to a problem or a solution to that bug in your code.</p>
	<p>Since then I have been teaching myself C++, JavaScript, HTML5 and CSS3.  This website has been created to document my journey and also to act as a portfolio.</p>
	<p>In my spare time I create what can loosely be called <a href="https://soundcloud.com/wrigzilla" target="_blank">music</a> using a variety of programs.  I am also interested in psychology, stand up comedy and anything to do with Space.</p>
